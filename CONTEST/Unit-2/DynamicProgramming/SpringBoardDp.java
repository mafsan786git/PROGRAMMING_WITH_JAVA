/**
 * Description
    The floor of 91 springboard is covered by h Ã— w square tiles, where there are h rows of tiles from front (first row) to back (last row) and w columns of tiles from left to right. Each tile has value of 1 to 100 written on it.
    You have to walk on tiles such that sum of numbers is as high as possible, subject to the following restrictions:
    You start by choosing any tile in the first row, and collects the value on that tile. Then, you move to a tile in the next row, collects the value on the tile, and so on until you reach the last row.
    When you move from one tile to a tile in the next row, you can only move to the tile just below it or diagonally to the left or right.
    Given the values of h and w, and the value on each tile, write a program to compute the maximum possible sum you can grab in one single trip from the first row to the last row.
Input
    Input Format :
        The first line consists of a single integer T, the number of test cases.
        In each of the test cases, the first line has two integers. The first integer h is the number of rows of tiles on the floor. The second integer w is the number of columns of tiles on the floor.
        Next, there are h lines of inputs. The i-th line of these, specifies the value in each tile of the i-th row from the front. Each line has w integers, where each integer m (0 <= m <= 100) is the number on that tile. The integers are separated by a space character.
    Constraints:
        1 <= T <= 100
        1 <= w <= 100
        1 <= h <= 100
Output
    The output should consist of T lines, one for each test case. Each line consists of a single integer, which is the maximum possible sum you can grab, in one single trip from the first row to the last row for the corresponding test case.
